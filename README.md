# CryptoClustering
Unsupervised Learning Clustering of Crypto values over one year

This project contrasts K-Means clustering of Crypto Data before and after optimization using PCA.

Overall, the use of PCA produced a tighter clustering of data with clear distinctions between clusters while still separating the outlier stocks (Celsius Degree Token and Ethlend) into their own unique clusters. The optimal value for "k" (4) did not change between the original scaled data and the PCA data.

Data processing and analysis are housed in the Jupyter notebook. 

Renders of the plots and input data are in the Resources Folder.
